# Home Game Studio
This is a set of games we have created using MonoGame that run on the iPad.

# Wizards
Simple game where a wizard copies walks and the background moves underneath it.

## Sessions
This is a log of the different session we have worked on to create this demo game.
1. **Cornflower blue background**. Create an inital application that can be deployed to the iPad that shows a background screen (cornflower blue).

2. **Image as background** Load an image and fill the background with it. We chose a forest from https://craftpix.net/freebies/free-cartoon-forest-game-backgrounds/

3. **Show a character** We chose the wizard pack from Craftpix. https://craftpix.net/freebies/wizard-character-free-sprite/

4. **Add Idle animation** Add idle animation to add a bit of movement to the character.

5. **Add walking animation** Make the character walk forward.

6. **Move the background** Move the background to the left so the that character appears to be moving forwards.


Still to do?
- jump animation to avoid obstacles
- obstacles to be added to the world to jump over
- death when you hit the obstacle
- score (number of seconds you can stay alive for?)
- background music
- sound effects on jump.
